On average, people spend [6 hours and 42 minutes](https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2019/01/30/digital-trends-2019-every-single-stat-you-need-to-know-about-the-internet/) online each day. 

**In North America, 327.6 million people** or 89% of the region’s population are **using the Internet**. They are searching for information, sharing on social media or shopping on e-commerce websites. 

According to [a survey](https://clutch.co/website-builders/resources/small-business-websites-2018), **less than two-thirds** (64%) of **small businesses have a website**. 

Living in the digital world, a **website is now a necessity for a business**, big or small. If you have a business and don’t have a website, you are probably **losing many great opportunities** for your business.

## 2. BUSINESS CREDIBILITY
