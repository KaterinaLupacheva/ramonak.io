A couple of days ago, while working on one of React projects with the use of a very popular UI library, I’ve stumbled upon a problem: I needed to make some style changes of the Progress Bar component. But after struggling with it for a few hours and being in a complete desperation (why isn’t it working as it is written in the documentation???), I’ve decided to create a Progress Bar component from scratch. Here how I’ve made it.

## 1. Create a progress-bar.component.js file

```jsx
import React from "react";

const ProgressBar = (props) => {
  const { bgcolor, completed } = props;
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <span>{`${completed}%`}</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProgressBar;
```

Basically, the component consists of the two parts:

1. the main parent div container - represents the whole bar
2. the child div -  completed part of the bar with the span which will show the completed percentage number.

Our custom progress bar component will receive just two props:

- *bgcolor* - background color of the completed part of the bar
- *completed* - number between 0 and 100

## 2. Add styling

Just for the sake of this tutorial, for styling, I’m going to use pure inline CSS. Another option would be to use the [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) library, but let’s keep it simple.

```jsx
const ProgressBar = (props) => {
  const { bgcolor, completed } = props;

  const containerStyles = {
    height: 20,
    width: '100%',
    backgroundColor: "#e0e0de",
    borderRadius: 50,
    margin: 50
  }

  const fillerStyles = {
    height: '100%',
    width: `${completed}%`,
    backgroundColor: bgcolor,
    borderRadius: 'inherit',
    textAlign: 'right'
  }

  const labelStyles = {
    padding: 5,
    color: 'white',
    fontWeight: 'bold'
  }

  return (
    <div style={containerStyles}>
      <div style={fillerStyles}>
        <span style={labelStyles}>{`${completed}%`}</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProgressBar;
```

Nothing fancy. Mostly background colors and a border-radius.

Let’s test what we’ve developed.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import "./App.css";
import ProgressBar from "./progress-bar.component";

const testData = [
  { bgcolor: "#6a1b9a", completed: 60 },
  { bgcolor: "#00695c", completed: 30 },
  { bgcolor: "#ef6c00", completed: 53 },
];

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {testData.map((item, idx) => (
        <ProgressBar key={idx} bgcolor={item.bgcolor} completed={item.completed} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Run the app and check what we’ve got in the browser.

And that’s it! The simple Progress Bar React component is ready!

## BONUS. Adding animation.
Well, actually, to animate the progress bar movement it is sufficient to add just one line into the *fillerStyles*:

```jsx
const fillerStyles = {
    ...
    transition: 'width 1s ease-in-out',
    ...
  }
```

To demonstrate animation in action I’m going to create a function, which will randomly generate the completed prop value every 2 sec. This function will be place inside the *useEffect* hook.

```jsx
function App() {
  const [completed, setCompleted] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setInterval(() => setCompleted(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1), 2000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <ProgressBar bgcolor={"#6a1b9a"} completed={completed} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

And that's the final result:

## Conclusion

And that’s it! In this short blog post, I’ve described a step-by-step process of creating a custom Progress Bar React component. This component is fully customizable, so you can add any additional styling and functionality depending on your project needs.

*The complete source code of the component is available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/KaterinaLupacheva/simple-progress-bar)*
