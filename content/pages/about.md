Hi! My name is Kate :high_heel:. I'm a full-stack web developer and freelancer :computer:.

Although I specialize in Dashboards and Admin Panels building, I'd be happy to help to develop any web application or web site to make the life of my clients from around the world :earth_americas: easier.

I'm a self-taught developer. And I'm continue to learn constantly :pencil:.

Currently for the full-stack development I prefer to use:

:small_blue_diamond: **JavaScript Stack**:

* Node.js / Express.js for backend
* React.js for frontend

AND / OR

:small_blue_diamond: **Java Stack** :

* Spring Boot for backend

* Vaadin Framework for frontend (<a href="/media/vaadin-certificate.pdf" target="_blank">Certified Vaadin 14 Developer</a>)

Other tools and technologies, that I use, include:

* Backend: Spring Framework (Data, Security, etc), Hibernate
* Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
* Frontend: HTML, (S)CSS, JavaScript
* Version Control: GitHub, BitBucket
* Maven, NPM, Webpack, Yarn, Redux

When not coding, you can find me playing the piano :notes: or the guitar :guitar:, listening to :headphones: Finish or Dutch metal, watching football (soccer) :soccer:, tennis or biathlon, reading a nice book :orange_book:, or just hanging out with my family :thumbsup:.
